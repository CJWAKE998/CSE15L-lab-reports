# Hello! This is a tutorial for lab report 1

The first step I did was make sure I had VScode installed on my computer

The next step is to attempt to remote connect to the ieng6 servers at UCSD. What I did was find my course-specific account and attempt to connect through VScode.

Here are some commands I was testing, as you can see they are running successfully.

Next, I attempted to securley copied a file on my computer, and then put it into the ieng6 server. Here is a screenshot of that successfully happening.
